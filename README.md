# Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering
Grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics to target marketing strategies effectively.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was part of my internship at Celebal Technologies. The main goal was to understand how unsupervised machine learning (KMeans) can help businesses group customers based on their spending patterns and income.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)
- scikit-learn (for KMeans clustering)

## 🔍 What I Did
- Started with cleaning and exploring the dataset.
- Visualized distributions of income, spending score, and other customer traits.
- Applied KMeans clustering to group customers into segments.
- Used scatter plots and pie charts to understand each cluster’s behavior.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Found patterns in customer behavior based on income and spending score.
- Identified target groups that could be useful for marketing or offers.
- Learned how to choose the right number of clusters visually (Elbow method).

## 📚 What I Learned
During this data science internship project, I gained hands-on experience with unsupervised learning techniques, specifically KMeans clustering. I learned how to apply the Elbow Method for model optimization and how to use data visualization to interpret cluster behavior. This helped me understand real-world customer segmentation and how data-driven insights support business decision-making.
